Scheduling App

This app persists data to mongo.

Tech used: React, Redux, Node.js, mongoDB

To get this to run, do the following:
1. open terminal
2. cd to directory you want to clone repo to
3. Run "git clone https://github.com/nhunt3/scheduling-app-redux.git"
4. Run "npm install"
5. Run "npm run build"
6. Run "node server.js"
7. Navigate to localhost:8080

Alternatively, for development work, do the following after step 4 instead:
  5. Run "npm start" in one tab
  6. Run "node server.js" in a separate tab

You should be good to go. Let me know if that's not the case.
