Scheduling App

This app persists data to mongo.

Tech used: React, Redux, Node.js, mongoDB

To get this to run, do the following:
1. open terminal
2. cd to directory you want to clone repo to
3. run "git clone https://github.com/nhunt3/scheduling-app-redux.git"
4. run "npm install"
5. Run "npm start" in one tab
6. Run "node server.js" in a separate tab

You should be good to go. Let me know if that's not the case.
